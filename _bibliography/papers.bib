              Motivation
              Bioactive peptides have gained great attention in the academy and pharmaceutical industry since they play an important role in human health. However, the increasing number of bioactive peptide databases is causing the problem of data redundancy and duplicated efforts. Even worse is the fact that the available data is non-standardized and often dirty with data entry errors. Therefore, there is a need for a unified view that enables a more comprehensive analysis of the information on this topic residing at different sites.
            
            
              Results
              After collecting web pages from a large variety of bioactive peptide databases, we organized the web content into an integrated graph database (starPepDB) that holds a total of 71 310 nodes and 348 505 relationships. In this graph structure, there are 45 120 nodes representing peptides, and the rest of the nodes are connected to peptides for describing metadata. Additionally, to facilitate a better understanding of the integrated data, a software tool (starPep toolbox) has been developed for supporting visual network analysis in a user-friendly way; providing several functionalities such as peptide retrieval and filtering, network construction and visualization, interactive exploration and exporting data options.

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9 deletion (CRISPR-del) is the leading approach for eliminating DNA from mammalian cells and underpins a variety of genome-editing applications. Target DNA, defined by a pair of double-strand breaks (DSBs), is removed during nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). However, the low efficiency of CRISPR-del results in laborious experiments and false-negative results. By using an endogenous reporter system, we show that repression of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)—an early step in NHEJ—yields substantial increases in DNA deletion. This is observed across diverse cell lines, gene delivery methods, commercial inhibitors, and guide RNAs, including those that otherwise display negligible activity. We further show that DNA-PKcs inhibition can be used to boost the sensitivity of pooled functional screens and detect true-positive hits that would otherwise be overlooked. Thus, delaying the kinetics of NHEJ relative to DSB formation is a simple and effective means of enhancing CRISPR-deletion.},

              The increasing interest in bioactive peptides with therapeutic potentials has been reflected in a large variety of biological databases published over the last years. However, the knowledge discovery process from these heterogeneous data sources is a nontrivial task, becoming the essence of our research endeavor. Therefore, we devise a unified data model based on molecular similarity networks for representing a chemical reference space of bioactive peptides, having an implicit knowledge that is currently not explicitly accessed in existing biological databases. Indeed, our main contribution is a novel workflow for the automatic construction of such similarity networks, enabling visual graph mining techniques to uncover new insights from the “ocean” of known bioactive peptides. The workflow presented here relies on the following sequential steps: (i) calculation of molecular descriptors by applying statistical and aggregation operators on amino acid property vectors; (ii) a two-stage unsupervised feature selection method to identify an optimized subset of descriptors using the concepts of entropy and mutual information; (iii) generation of sparse networks where nodes represent bioactive peptides, and edges between two nodes denote their pairwise similarity/distance relationships in the defined descriptor space; and (iv) exploratory analysis using visual inspection in combination with clustering and network science techniques. For practical purposes, the proposed workflow has been implemented in our visual analytics software tool (
              http://mobiosd-hub.com/starpep/
              ), to assist researchers in extracting useful information from an integrated collection of 45120 bioactive peptides, which is one of the largest and most diverse data in its field. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed workflow for discovering central nodes in molecular similarity networks that may represent a biologically relevant chemical space known to date.},
